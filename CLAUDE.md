# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the public repository for **MAT 205 — Introduction à la Théorie des Anneaux et des Corps** (Introduction to Ring and Field Theory), taught at Université Galatasaray, 2025–2026. The course language is French.

The repo contains course PDFs (lecture notes, TD problem sheets, quizzes, syllabus) and a `private` git submodule (hosted on GitLab) for grading and internal materials.

## Structure

- Root: public course materials (`cours.pdf`, `td*.pdf`, `quiz*.pdf`, `Syllabus.pdf`)
- `private/`: git submodule (`git@gitlab.com:onayg/mat301-private.git`) containing grades, corrected scans, and internal scripts — not to be shared publicly

## Course Topics (for mathematical context)

Rings (Z, Z/nZ, polynomial rings, matrix rings), ideals, quotients, homomorphisms, isomorphism theorems, irreducibility (Eisenstein), PIDs, UFDs, field extensions, minimal polynomials, finite fields.

## Conventions

- All course content is in **French**
- When explaining mathematics, build intuition first then formalize; connect to the broader algebraic landscape
- LaTeX is the expected format for any mathematical writing
